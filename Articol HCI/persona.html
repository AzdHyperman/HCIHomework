            <p>I had comeback from my job and stared to listen some music from my playlist but there was missing some melodies i used to listen in the past.
                Happly i discovered this web app that saved the playlist in my account.I really found it some of them by title.
                Wish i could've discovered this app earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was navigatiing on the internet and i decided to watch some videos in my playlist.
                I noticed that some videos are missing but there is not title.
                I sent an email to google support but no result. Even if i had the link.
                I decided to search an app that save the playlist. That saved my life cuz i dont need to download everything i want due the lack of space on my phone and my pc.

            <p>I was back to home to enjoy my time on youtube, I saved severaly music videos in my playlist. I noticed some of them got privated or deleted.  </p>
            <p> I asked a friend if i can find them somewhere. My friend recommended to use Wayback machine website but it took to much and didn have much result since im not good with this kind of stuff.
                Then a asked another friend and showed me this app.He said that he had the same problem and this app was what he is looking for.
                I tryed this app too, the setup was pretty easy only connecting with my gmail account and way to go. In next day i recieve some emails and showed my the title of the deleted videos.
                All i have to do is to find similar videos on yotube problem solved.
