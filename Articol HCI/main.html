                <h3> Description</h3>
                <p>
                    In context of youtube deleting the videos or put videos in private I created an app of purpose to save the videos titles from your playlist.
                    That would help people that saved music videos that got deleted due the copyright claim or the channel associated got deleted entirely.
                    That leaves with only unavailable videos in your playlist.
                    Also it would help you remind what videos got deleted in your playlist since everytime a video got deleted or was privated by the user it does not show the title anymore.
